All that I want is a hole in the ground. You can tell me when it's alright for me to come out.
I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me.
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke.
For all I know, the best is over and the worst is yet to come.
Reality will break your heart.
Remember when we used to like ourselves?
I don't pick up when you call cause your voice is a gun.
Strange how we found ourselves exactly where we left off.
Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey.
I can't call you a stranger but I can't call you.
Of all the weapons you fight with your silence is the most violent.
Don't you go and get it twisted; forgiveness is not forgetting.
Everything was fine until you came around.
As if the first cut wasn't deep enough, I dove in again cause I'm not into giving up.
Could've got the same rush from any lover's touch. But why get used to something new when no one breaks my heart like you.
You may hate me but I can't hate you. And I won't erase you.
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter.
I don't need no help I can sabotage me by myself.
We all got problems don't we? We all need heroes don't we? But rest assured there's not a single person here who's worthy.
I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape you, but we can let the light illuminate these hopeless places.
Think it's safe to say your savior doesn't look a thing like me.
I got my own convictions and they're stronger than any addiction.
Hold onto hope if you got it. Don't let it go for nobody.
They say that dreaming is free but I wouldn't care what it cost me.
Some things I'll never know, and I had to let them go. I'm sitting all alone, feeling empty...
I’ve seen love die way too many times when it deserved to be alive. I’ve seen you cry way too many times when you deserve to be alive.
You do your best to show me love, but you don’t know what love is.
So this is how it goes. Well, I, I would have never known. And if it ends today, well, I’ll still say that you shine brighter than anyone.
If you run away now, will you come back around? And if you ran away, I’d still wave goodbye, watching you shine bright.
I’ll write you just to let you know that I’m alright. Can’t say I’m sad to see you go cause I’m not.
Maybe if my heart stops beating, it won’t hurt this much. And never will I have to answer again to anyone.
Explain to me this conspiracy against me, and tell me how I’ve lost my power.
Where can I turn? Cause I need something more. Surrounded by uncertainty, I’m so unsure. Tell me why I feel so alone.
I thought that we’d make it because you said that we’d make it through. And when all security fails, will you be there to help me through?
So we stand here now and no one knows us at all. I won’t get used to this. I won’t get used to being gone. And going back won’t feel the same if we aren’t staying. Going back to get away after everything has changed.
I’ve hoped for change, and it gets better everyday. I’ve hoped for change, but still I feel the same.
Sing us a song and we’ll sing it back to you. We could sing our own but what would it be without you?
This heart, it beats, beats for only you.
They taped over your mouth, scribbled out the truth with their lies.
Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone.
I'd rather waste my life pretending then have to forget you for one whole minute.
That never happens... I guess I'm dreaming again.
How can I decide what's right when you're clouding up my mind?
You won't take away my pride... not this time.
How did we get here, when I used to know you so well?
I don't know what I want.
